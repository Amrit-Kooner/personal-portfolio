                <p>
                  This project was my first attempt at cloning a website and I
                  chose Google specifically as it seemed simple to clone because
                  I wanted a small project to do over the weekend. However, I
                  quickly realized that I had underestimated this project, as it
                  had many complex components such as the recommended drop-down
                  search results, as well as the search-by-image and
                  search-by-voice features. The hardest part was the recommended
                  drop-down search results as it required a lot of JavaScript
                  which I wasn‚Äôt so comfortable using at the time. Annoyingly, a
                  couple of days after I finished the project the actual Google
                  website was visually updated being the Google apps and Google
                  account drop-down sections. Overall it gave me quite a
                  challenge and it took me around 3 weeks to complete because it
                  had many complex components as previously mentioned and it was
                  created alongside my Fromhardware e-commerce project. From it,
                  I improved my JavaScript DOM manipulation, and HTML
                  structuring, as well as my CSS flexbox and element
                  positioning.

                <span class="project-divider"></span>
                <p>
                  This project was inspired by another project I created at my
                  University for my Database and Web Application Development
                  module, which was also a gaming e-commerce website called
                  Fromhardware. However, that was a full CRUD full-stack project
                  which utilized a backend server powered by XAMPP, SQL, and
                  PHP, to store, edit, delete, create, read, and manage various
                  objects, such as video games that were displayed on the
                  webpage. I decided not to include that project as it contained
                  messy, spaghetti code and it utilized Bootstrap which I
                  dislike. This current project is purely frontend in nature
                  since I have not actively used XAMPP, PHP, and SQL for some
                  time. It is the first web-related project in over a year and
                  the first that utilizes JavaScript and heavy CSS flexboxes.
                  Overall, it was fairly simple to build and more of a quick
                  refresher of the skills I have forgotten in the past, it took
                  me between 2 and 3 weeks to complete as it was built alongside
                  my Google Clone project From it, I improved my JavaScript DOM
                  manipulation, and HTML structuring, as well as my CSS flexbox
                  and element positioning.

                <p>
                  This project is my personal proudest and most well-built in
                  terms of UI design and code, as it's very clean using best
                  practices in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. A lot of time and care
                  was put into this project as it's my most important one since
                  it‚Äôs a portfolio, it will be my first project that potential
                  employers see. And because of this, I wanted to make it more
                  personalized and unique to make it stand out more. So I
                  incorporated many features, such as a sidebar menu having
                  utility buttons like a mute and settings button. It has a mute
                  button as it was intended to have sound effects with
                  interactable, and a settings page where the user can
                  personalize and alter the color of the website. However, the
                  logic for the mute and settings buttons hasn‚Äôt yet been
                  implemented due to time constants. It was my first project
                  have utilized transition animations which were used on the
                  burger menu and sidebar, and my first that used CSS grid-box
                  which was used on the projects and skills page. Overall, it
                  was a very difficult and stress-worthy project as I don‚Äôt see
                  myself as a good designer even though the design here is very
                  aesthetic, it took me a while to think of these design
                  choices. Also, since it had many complex components and logic,
                  such as the sidebar and burger menu incorporated with
                  JavaScript for toggling their status and loading/saving their
                  state in the user‚Äôs local storage. This project took me around
                  over a month to complete since it's my most polished and
                  well-built yet and due to the difficulty as I previously
                  mentioned. From it, I have learned more about using transition
                  animations and gridbox in CSS, while also gaining experience
                  in a more designer-focused mindset as I had to think very hard
                  about design choices to use to ensure the project was
                  aesthetically pleasant. I also further improved my HTML
                  structuring, CSS flexbox, and element positioning.

                <span class="project-divider"></span>
                <p>
                  This project was created at my University for my Artificial
                  Intelligence and Machine Learning module, where I collaborated
                  with a team of four members to create supervised machine
                  learning algorithms for predicting spectral classes based on a
                  given dataset. Each team member was responsible for developing
                  a distinct algorithm model suited to our dataset. I chose to
                  implement a logistic regression algorithm for this purpose. We
                  used Python, along with libraries such as Scikit-learn for
                  machine learning, Pandas for data manipulation, and
                  Seaborn/Matplotlib for data visualization. Our dataset
                  comprised 17 features and 100,000 observations, representing
                  real-world data related to stellar classification. The goal
                  was to predict the spectral class of each observation, which
                  could be one of three possibilities: star, galaxy, or quasar.
                  One of the 17 features served as the target variable for this
                  supervised multiclass classification problem, establishing the
                  ground truth for our models. We aimed to build and compare
                  four different classification models to accurately predict the
                  spectral class of each observation. Overall, it took the team
                  around 2 months to complete as we had to also make a report
                  with the algorithm. It was a very interesting and fun project.
                  From it, I learned many new topics throughout this module
                  involving Machine Learning with developing a supervised
                  classification algorithm being logistic regression using
                  libraries such as pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-Learn. As well as
                  comparing it with other developed classification algorithms
                  with graph visualization using libraries such as Matplotlib,
                  Seaborn, and Yellowbrick.

                <span class="project-divider"></span>
                <p>
                  This project was created at my University as my final year
                  dissertation for my Individual Honours Project module, where I
                  decided to build a universal voice control TV remote aimed
                  towards legacy TVs without built-in voice control
                  functionality. Features include compatibility with all TV
                  models, traditional buttons, and a Bluetooth-connected mobile
                  app. Initially, the voice recognition was meant to be further
                  improved using AI/ML and NLP with the NLTK library in Python,
                  but time constraints prevented from this being implemented.
                  The project aims to make voice-controlled technology
                  accessible to those without smart TVs, benefiting people with
                  disabilities and improving the TV viewing experience for all,
                  with the goal of simplifying lives. This project was developed
                  using Arduino with C++ and various libraries, including EEPROM
                  to save hex codes in the Arduino ROM for remote code storage,
                  IRremote for TV remote code recognition, VoiceRecognitionV3 to
                  map voice commands to IR outputs, and SoftwareSerial for
                  Bluetooth module communication. The app was created using MIT
                  App Inventor as it allows easy connectivity to the main device
                  via Bluetooth, enabling it to be controlled from the app to
                  control the TV. MIT app inventor was used as it offers voice
                  recognition with Google Voice To Text which is used to add
                  voice control to the app. Overall, this project was very
                  challenging as it involved many concepts I was not familiar
                  with such as C++, Bluetooth technologies, Arduino, and circuit
                  development and design. Also, it had many complex features. It
                  took me the entire third year to complete because I had to not
                  only build it but also write a report detailing my development
                  journey and present it. From it, I learned how to program in
                  C++ and develop and design Arduino circuits with it.

                <p>
                  This project was created at my University for my User
                  Experience and Design, and Mobile and wearable Application
                  Development modules, where I designed and developed a charity
                  android CRUD app called Huddle that allows its users to donate
                  to charities/fundraisers, create/delete fundraisers and also
                  view charity news/events, with admin users additionally able
                  to create/update/delete news/event posts. I chose to create a
                  charity app as we were tasked to create one that could
                  positively impact the world. I got the idea and created the
                  designs of the app in my User Experience and Design module
                  using Figma, while I developed the app in my Mobile and
                  wearable Application Development module using Android Studio.
                  My Figma designs have many features that were cut due to time
                  restrictions, resource limitations, or errors. These being a
                  color blindness settings page using the Android Accessibility
                  API, include an inbox page for users to create chat rooms,
                  search, and message others. For payment processing, integrate
                  Google/PayPal/Web Stripe APIs, access the JustGiving API for
                  charity and fundraiser data, enable sharing on social media
                  using Twitter and Facebook APIs, and utilize the Retrofit as a
                  REST client library to interact with web APIs for charity and
                  donation platform data retrieval. Overall, it took me 2-3
                  months to complete, and it was very challenging since I had
                  not used Java for several months and had no prior experience
                  with Android Studio. It was a massive CRUD project with
                  complex features like admin login, email verification, real
                  payment transactions using WebView, and many more. From it, I
                  learned how to use Figma while improving my designing and
                  creativity skills, as well as Android Studio while improving
                  my knowledge of Java OOP.

                <p>
                  This project was initially built in Python several years ago
                  when I was learning the language, and it was played through
                  the terminal. Recently, I decided to recreate it from scratch
                  blindly using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS as it would be more
                  interactive and an overall better project. It also gave me the
                  chance to my understanding of DOM manipulation and general
                  JavaScript. I didn‚Äôt focus on CSS on this project, it was
                  mainly to test and improve my DOM manipulation skills.
                  Overall, the project proved to be quite challenging with it
                  taking me a week and a half, mainly due to recurring issues
                  such as double confirmation pop-up notifications, where users
                  had to confirm their actions twice, and also because I have
                  not programmed in OOP in a few months with the last time in
                  Java so it took me time to get used to its syntax. From it, I
                  gained a better understanding of OOP and DOM manipulation in
                  JavaScript.

                <p>
                  This project was a remake of the first website I ever created
                  during my first year at University as part of my Web Design
                  and Development module. It was remade because I knew it could
                  be significantly improved by implementing the new skills and
                  best practices I have learned. Since it was my first website,
                  it had a lot of messy spaghetti code. The project was based on
                  a real place called Sunnycroft, which is a historic property
                  located in Wellington, Shropshire, England. It is a
                  Victorian-era suburban villa that has been preserved and is
                  now open to the public as a museum. Overall, it was very
                  simple to build as the layout and design were not complex, so
                  it only took me around a week to complete. It was enjoyable
                  revisiting and rebuilding my first-ever website, and it became
                  clear to me just how much I had grown as a developer up to
                  that point. From it, even though the project was simple I
                  improved my HTML structuring, CSS flexbox, and element
                  positioning.

                <p>
                  This project was my first attempt of linking and fetching data
                  asynchronous from an API to then display it using DOM
                  manipulation. I decided to make a weather web-app as its
                  simple concept since its my first APIs project, and also
                  because the API used was very simple and straightforward to
                  setup being the Open Weather API. Originally, it was developed
                  so the user could only search by city, but then I relasized it
                  would be better if the user could also search by the country
                  as well to filter out cities with the same name. HTML and CSS
                  was not the main focus of this project but it still ended up
                  being visually appealing. Overall, it was a intesting and
                  enjoyable project as it involved new conepetes for me to learn
                  being Asyrcnous programming with the fetch API function. It
                  took me 3-4 days to complete as it wasn‚Äôt a large project with
                  it having only a few hundren lines of HTML, CSS and
                  JavsScript. From it, I gained a better grasp at Asyrcnous
                  programming with the fetch API function in JavaScript as well
                  as DOM maniputlation.
